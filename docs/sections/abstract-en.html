<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Audience Types Controlled Vocabulary was created for NSF's EarthCube program's Resource Registry. The vocabulary defines the types of audience each resource in the program is targeted to.  At this point the vocabulary is very bare - no term definitions even; however, the intention is to extend the vocabulary over time.  If you would like to assist with this or in extending any of the other controlled vocabularies/ontologies developed as part of the Resource Registry project, please see https://github.com/earthcubearchitecture-ecresourcereg.</span>
